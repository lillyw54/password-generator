# password-generator

    THE WHY:
In this project the end goal was to have the "generate password" button be effective. 

When generating the password a specific requirement is needed in order to be successful. Including a minimum of 8 characters and a max of 128 with upper and lower case letters as well as numbers. 

    THE HOW:
In order to create a working button I needed to know the fundamentals of how a button is created and what needs to be used to create that. For this, I used the following link:
